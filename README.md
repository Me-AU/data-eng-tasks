# Data Engineering Tasks:

Below are 3 groups of tasks, each of which test a specified skill in the data-engineering domain.

## 1. SQL

The SQL sub-tasks required both technical SQL skills and theoretical relational database knowledge, which are listed below:

- Query Optimization
- Data Transformation
- Database Design
- Indexing

Read the full [documentation](https://github.com/Me-AU/data-eng-tasks/blob/main/Task1_SQL/documentation/README.md) of every step taken and decision made, or follow this guide to [test it yourself](https://github.com/Me-AU/data-eng-tasks/blob/main/Task1_SQL/documentation/SETUP.md).

## 2. MongoDB

The MongoDB sub-tasks involve working with MongoDB, proposing a schema, and outlining model creation. The tasks are as follows:

- Schema Design
- Model Creation
- Query to Update Existing Data
- Query to Add New Data

Read the complete [documentation](https://github.com/Me-AU/data-eng-tasks/blob/main/Task2_MongoDB/documentation/README.md) for detailed steps and decisions made, or follow this guide to [test it yourself](https://github.com/Me-AU/data-eng-tasks/blob/main/Task2_MongoDB/documentation/SETUP.md).

## 3. Feature Engineering (Python)

The Feature Engineering sub-tasks required theoretical knowledge and involved working with multiple libraries. The tasks are as follows:

- Data Cleaning
- Feature Extraction
- Age Grouping
- Fare Binning
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Correlation Analysis
